Brief description of your startup.*

Begg is revolutionizing the way gifts and money are requested, given, and received, while simultaneously boosting African businesses by promoting their services and deals. Begg simplifies three things: giving, receiving and requesting gifts and cash which not only makes our users happy but can be a perfect product for content creators, sports stars, SMEs, vendors and hypermarkets. Our innovative platform also creates an engaging social network where users can share their wants and needs with a closed circle or the broader public.

Begg seamlessly integrates thousands of vendors, SMEs, and hypermarkets through APIs, ensuring a diverse range of options for users and these options makes payment transactions much easier. Think of how seamless it is to pay thousands of people with just a link. Life has never been more seamless due to Begg. Since our public beta launch in May 30 2024, we've enabled users to purchase electronic gift vouchers from various Nigerian businesses. Now, with the MVP version of our product live, users can buy gifts and deals, compile and share Wishlists, and send or receive cash—all supported by a secure digital wallet.

Our mission is to foster a vibrant community while driving growth for local businesses and most importantly make payments seamless for super stars and sport stars. By simplifying the gifting process and connecting consumers with vendors, Begg is poised to become an essential platform for social and commercial interactions across Africa and we can even scale to a Global phase if we receive the Funding.

What motivated you to start this company?*

As a content creator in Africa, I have faced significant challenges in monetizing my work. Despite having over 5,000 followers on Facebook, I struggled to find an easy and effective way to collect support from fans. The current payment systems in Africa involves a lot of back and forth, making transactions cumbersome and inefficient. Payments are often delayed, fees are high, and there is lack of seamless integration across platforms, which creates numerous barriers for creators and consumers.

With a background as a software engineer, I have the technical expertise to address these challenges. My passion for creating a smoother and more inclusive financial ecosystem drove me to start Begg. I wanted to develop a platform that not only simplifies the process of requesting, giving, and receiving gifts and money but also helps African businesses promote their services and deals.

By creating Begg, I aim to build a vibrant community where users can easily share their needs and support one another, all while driving growth for local businesses. My ultimate goal is to transform the financial landscape in Africa, making it more accessible and efficient for everyone.

Even worse, I have always wanted to have a socially-inclined payment system that makes it easier to send and receive funds from my friends or fans without stress by just getting a link I can send to all or having a profile they can easily fund or send gift to. This will help superstars who need to collect gifts or support from fans.

What does your product or service do? What makes it unique?*

Begg is a revolutionary platform that simplifies the process of requesting, giving, and receiving gifts and money. It allows users to purchase gifts and deals, compile and share Wishlists, and send or receive cash, all backed by a secure digital wallet. We integrate thousands of vendors, SMEs, and hypermarkets through APIs, providing a wide range of options for users.

Begg is great because we are a socially inclined payment app that allows its users to send and receive money easily from different people(even crowdfunding gets easier). If a user has an existing community and wishes to get money from each of them easily, just a link will do and these form of payments works in rural areas with low electricity as it can work offline too. Also, collecting money globally is a big hassle especially in Nigeria and most fintech apps in Nigeria have not touched this problem and that is a big problem we are solving at Begg. Perfect option for freelancers
